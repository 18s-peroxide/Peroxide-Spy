# Peroxide-Spy
Peroxide is a brand new remote spy that aims to facilitate the process of remote finding and looping. Peroxide contains its own built in console, code viewer and full origin viewer with every detail you may need for you exploiting process. I hope you enjoy this tool as much as I do.

Usage Guide:

• Icons
Loop Icon: Will loop the chosen remote event at 0.15 until it is stopped. If you would like a higher loop rate simply set up your own loop in your executor and set a faster time. We do not recommend the usage of while wait() do.

• Minimize, Close, Maximize
The following are self explanatory.

• Scroll bar/list icon and file icon with code symbol: The scroll bar will show you the origin of the remote/whatever it is and the view code button will display the code so you can copy, inspect or loop it.
The rest of the icons dont need much explaining. Enjoy your usage!
